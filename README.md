# AdGuard VPN endpoint

## Building

Execute the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
cargo build
```
to build the debug version, or
```shell
cargo build --release
```
to build the release version.

## Issuing self-signed cert and keys (RSA)

Execute the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
openssl req -config <openssl.conf> -new -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 1000 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```
where
* `<openssl.conf>` is an optional OpenSSL request template file

## Endpoint configuration

### Library configuration

An endpoint can be configured using a JSON file. The file struct reflects the library settings
(see `struct Settings` in [settings.rs](./lib/src/settings.rs)).
For a detailed description of the features see [here](./lib/README.md#features-description).
The very basic configuration file can be found in [the example](#example-endpoint).

The full set of settings is shown bellow in the pseudo-json format:
* the lines which start with `///` are comments
* an item marked with `Default(x)` is set to `x` in case it is omitted
* an item marked with `Optional` may be omitted, it will turn off the corresponding feature
* an item marked with `Enum` may take one of the listed values; for example, authenticator may be
  `"authenticator": { "file": { "path": "/creds.txt" } }` as well as
  `"authenticator": { "radius": { "address": "127.0.0.1:1813" } }`

### Executable configuration

Some options reside on the application level. Such options can be configured via command
line arguments. For example:

* [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) is configured
  by specifying `--sentry_dsn <url>`
* Logging level is configured by `[--log_level|-l] [info|debug|trace]` (`info` - default)
* Logging file is configured by `--log_file <path>`. If not specified, the instance logs
  to `stdout`.

To see the full set of available options, execute the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
<path/to/target>/vpn_endpoint -h
```

## Running

To run the binary through `cargo`, execute the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
cargo run --bin vpn_endpoint -- <path/to/vpn.config>
```

To run the binary directly, execute the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
<path/to/target>/vpn_endpoint <path/to/vpn.config>
```
where `<path/to/target>` is determined by the build command (by default it is `./target/debug` or
`./target/release` depending on the build type).

## Example endpoint

For a quic setup you can run the example endpoint (see [here](./examples/my_vpn)).
It shows the essential things needed to run an instance.
To start one run the following commands in Terminal:
```shell
cd ./examples/my_vpn && ./run.sh
```
It may ask you to enter some information for generating your certificate.
Skip it clicking `enter` if it does not matter.

## Testing with Google Chrome

1) 2 options:
   * Add the generated certificate to the trusted store and run the Google Chrome
   * Run the Google Chrome from Terminal like this:
    ```shell
    google-chrome --ignore-certificate-errors
    ```
   **IMPORTANT:** the second option should be used just for testing, it removes the first line
                  of defence against malicious resources
2) Set up the endpoint as an HTTPS proxy server in the browser (either via browser settings or 
using an extension like `Proxy SwitchyOmega`)

## Collecting metrics

Common ways:

* As plain text: send a GET request to `<ip>:<port>/metrics`, for example, using CURL
or a web browser
* Set up Prometheus:
  1) Configure the instance to monitor the endpoint metrics (see [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configure-prometheus-to-monitor-the-sample-targets))
  2) Use [the graph interface](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#using-the-graphing-interface)
