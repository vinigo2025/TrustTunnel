# AdGuard VPN endpoint

## Building

Execute the following commands in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo build
```

to build the debug version, or

```shell
cargo build --release
```

to build the release version.

## Endpoint configuration

### Library configuration

An endpoint can be configured using a couple of TOML files:

1) The main library settings reflect (`struct Settings` in [settings.rs](./lib/src/settings.rs)).
2) The TLS hosts library settings reflect (`struct TlsHostsSettings` in [settings.rs](./lib/src/settings.rs)).
   These settings may be reloaded dynamically (see [here](#dynamic-reloading-of-tls-hosts-settings) for details).

All of them may be generated using the [setup wizard](./tools/setup_wizard) tool.
To configure the most basic options, execute the following command in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo run --bin setup_wizard
```

To see the full set of available options, execute the following command in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo run --bin setup_wizard -- -h
```

### Endpoint executable features

#### Configuration

Some options reside on the application level. Such options can be configured via command
line arguments. For example:

* [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) is configured
  by specifying `--sentry_dsn <url>`
* Logging level is configured by `[--log_level|-l] [info|debug|trace]` (`info` - default)
* Logging file is configured by `--log_file <path>`. If not specified, the instance logs
  to `stdout`.

To see the full set of available options, execute the following command in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo run --bin vpn_endpoint -- -h
```

#### Dynamic reloading of TLS hosts settings

The executable is able to reload TLS hosts settings dynamically. To trigger this, send the SIGHUP signal
to the process. After receiving, it reparses the TLS hosts settings file that was passed in arguments and
applies the new settings.

**IMPORTANT:** the file paths passed through the settings must remain valid until the process exit or until
the next reloading.

## Running

To run the binary through `cargo`, execute the following commands in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo run --bin vpn_endpoint -- <path/to/vpn.config> <path/to/tls_hosts.config>
```

To run the binary directly, execute the following commands in the Terminal:

```shell
<path/to/target>/vpn_endpoint <path/to/vpn.config> <path/to/tls_hosts.config>
```

where `<path/to/target>` is determined by the build command (by default it is `./target/debug` or
`./target/release` depending on the build type).

## Testing with Google Chrome

1) 2 options:
    * Add the generated certificate to the trusted store and run the Google Chrome
    * Run the Google Chrome from Terminal like this:
    ```shell
    google-chrome --ignore-certificate-errors
    ```
   **IMPORTANT:** the second option should be used just for testing, it removes the first line
   of defence against malicious resources
2) Set up the endpoint as an HTTPS proxy server in the browser (either via browser settings or
   using an extension like `Proxy SwitchyOmega`)

## Collecting metrics

Common ways:

* As plain text: send a GET request to `<ip>:<port>/metrics`, for example, using CURL
  or a web browser
* Set up Prometheus:
    1) Configure the instance to monitor the endpoint metrics (see [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configure-prometheus-to-monitor-the-sample-targets))
    2) Use [the graph interface](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#using-the-graphing-interface)
